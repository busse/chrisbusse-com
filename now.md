## Travel

I have upcoming trips planned to:

 - Sep 2021: Washington, DC
 - Nov 2021: Washington, DC

Places I intend to plan travel to in the near future include: Nashville, TN; NYC; Europe 2022.

## Work

### Marketing / Partnerships

Getting ready for the Fall 2021 conference & event season, as people figure out what B2B networking looks like "in person" these days; helping to support the [Terazo](https://terazo.com) team's presence at:

 - All Things Open
 - Twilio SIGNAL
 - a private enterprise networking event in ATL
 - a couple of webinars [details to follow]

### Recruiting

I've been personally involved in recruiting for a few new roles at [Terazo](https://terazo.com), but that is coming to an end for the moment soon as they get filled. However, I'm always open to a conversation about any of the jobs posted on our [Careers](https://terazo.com/careers) page.

## Photography

I'm working through figuring out the right workflow between cameras, computing devices, editing apps, sharing services, etc. to figure out a workflow that actually works for me. Some days I think I'm getting close, some days I despair that I'm taking more pictures than I'll even be able to get through. I feel like I'm making some recent progress -- enough to document my gear & workflow setup soon.

## This Site

This /now page is part of the relaunch of this website which happened during the week of August 23, 2021. I want to get a couple of months of iterations on it behind me before making and sort of grand procolomation about what it's going to be -- but I do hope to write up an editorial calendar/cadence of sorts soon.

## Personal

My kids go back to "in person" school after Labor Day (US). I expect there will be a lot of adjustment for them and all of us in the house.
