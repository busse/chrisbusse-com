After dropping the kids off at school this morning, I swung through the McDonald's drive through to get some coffee and something with bacon in it. The signboard with all of the menu options on it was promoting a "Glazed Pull Apart Donut - Limited Time Only"! Succumbing to the classing "fear of loss" sales technique they employed, I added one to my order.

As I drove around to the first window, my early morning cynicism kicked in, "Why are they promoting a 'pull apart donut' in the middle of a pandemic? That doesn't seem like a hyngenic way to share food."

When I got home, I offered some of it to my wife in the spirit of sharing. She declined, intent on enjoying her savory hashbrowns.

When I went to take my first bite of the donut, I suddenly realized how wrong I was to be cynical about this 'pull apart donut' -- it was sheer genius! It didn't pull apart to make it easier to share and spread germs with your hands, it pulled apart to make it easier to eat.

It's not really a donut. It's actually seven glazed donut holes attached to each other in a single cluster. Rather than have to bite into a sticky messy crumbly mass of regular donut, a gentle nibble and pull releases a sweet single bite-sized donut hole that just pops right into your mouth.

My cynical assumption was wrong. This was product development at its finest. This pull apart donut met a need I subconciously had, but it wasn't aware of.

My beard stayed clean, and I enjoyed all 310 calories of it, 44.2857143 calories at a time. 

(And for the record, it tasts _a lot_ like a Krispy Kreme donut.)
